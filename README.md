# Mini Projects Using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT:
I’ve recently worked on a few mini projects to strengthen my frontend development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Here are five mini projects I built after understanding and analyzing code from YouTube tutorials:

## Old Age Free Bus:

  Determines eligibility for a free bus pass based on age, Aadhar card, and seat availability.

## Kids Game:

  An interactive math game designed for children.

## BMI Calculator:

  Calculates Body Mass Index based on user input (height and weight).

## Lottery Game:

  An interactive lottery game where users can pick a random number and receive surprise gifts.

## Online Shopping:

  Allows users to add available products to their cart and sort products based on price.
